"""
Idempotent index creation — runs at startup, safe to re-run.

We already have single-column indexes on foreign keys (they come free from
the ForeignKey declarations) and a unique constraint on user_follows that
doubles as a composite index. This module adds the COMPOSITE and PARTIAL
indexes that accelerate our hot queries — the ones that currently do
seq scans because PostgreSQL can't efficiently combine multiple
single-column indexes for the WHERE + ORDER BY of our real queries.

Why not CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY:
  CONCURRENTLY can't run inside a transaction, and SQLAlchemy's
  engine.begin() implicitly opens one. For a free-tier Postgres with
  < 100K rows per table, the brief ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock during a
  regular CREATE INDEX is a few milliseconds — acceptable. If we ever
  get to millions of rows, revisit with a proper maintenance window.

Dialect safety:
  Most syntax here (IF NOT EXISTS, partial indexes, DESC order) works
  on both SQLite (local dev) and PostgreSQL (Render). Anything
  Postgres-specific is gated on engine.dialect.name.
