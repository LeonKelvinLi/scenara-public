/**
 * src/data/releases.ts — typed release notes powering the in-app /releases route
 *
 * Mirrors CHANGELOG.md at the repo root.  Keep the two in sync — the markdown
 * file is what GitHub readers see, the array below is what the app renders.
 *
 * Convention:
 *   - newest release first
 *   - kind controls the bullet colour + emoji prefix in the UI
 *   - keep blurbs short and user-facing; technical detail belongs in the commit
